/**
 * THE PAGE — FABINS is a single-page site, so this file is its table of contents.
 *
 * Read top to bottom, the sections tell the sales story in order:
 *   Hero        → what FABINS is
 *   Marquee     → what it does, at a glance
 *   Problem     → why manual inspection fails
 *   About       → why retrofit rather than replace
 *   System      → how it works, end to end
 *   Standards   → how defects are scored (ASTM D5430 Four-Point)
 *   Innovators  → who built it
 *   Contact     → how to get it
 *
 * ─── TO REORDER OR ADD A SECTION ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   1. Move or add the component below — this order is the page order.
 *   2. Update `NAV_LINKS` in `lib/data/site.ts` to match, so the navbar, the
 *      footer, and the scroll-spy stay in step.
 * Each section owns its own `id`, spacing, and background; there is deliberately
 * no layout logic here beyond the order itself.
