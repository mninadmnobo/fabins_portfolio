/**
 * CONTACT API — the single boundary between the UI and the backend.
 *
 * `ContactSection` calls `submitDeploymentRequest()` and renders pending,
 * success, and error states from what it returns. Nothing else in
 * `components/` knows that an HTTP call happens at all, so changing transport,
 * adding retries, or moving to a server action means editing only this file.
 *
 * ─── BACKEND ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Talks to `POST /api/v1/deployment-requests` in the Spring Boot service under
 * `backend/`. That endpoint is public; the admin endpoints on the same resource
 * require credentials and are deliberately never called from the browser.
 *
 * ─── CONFIGURATION ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Set the API origin in `frontend/.env.local` for local work, and in the
 * Vercel project's environment variables for deployments:
 *
 *   local        NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
 *   production   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://fabins-api.onrender.com
 *   custom domain NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.fabins.com
 *
 * Origin only — no `/api/v1`, no trailing slash. Both are stripped below if
 * present, but the canonical form is the bare origin.
 *
 * Changing it on Vercel requires a redeploy: `NEXT_PUBLIC_` values are inlined
 * into the bundle at build time, not read at runtime.
 *
 * The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is required for the value to be readable in the
 * browser. It is therefore visible to anyone who views the page — never put a
 * secret in a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable.
 *
 * Whatever origin is set here must also appear in `FABINS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` on
 * the backend, or the browser will block the response. See
 * `docs/CICD_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md` §4.
