/**
 * PEOPLE — the team behind FABINS.
 *
 * Single source of truth, read by `InnovatorsSection` (the cards and the
 * profile modal) and by the `Footer` (the "Innovators" column). The footer used
 * to hardcode its own copy of these names and roles; it now reads from here, so
 * editing a person in one place updates both.
 *
 * ─── TO ADD A TEAM MEMBER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Append an entry to `fabinsInnovators` below and drop their portrait into
 * `public/`. Both the card grid and the footer list pick it up automatically.
 * Note the cards render in a two-column grid, so an odd number leaves a gap.
 *
 * ─── TO REMOVE A LINK ROW FROM A PROFILE ────────────────────────────────────
 * Delete the field. Every `social` entry is optional and the modal only renders
 * rows that have a value.
