/**
 * NAVIGATION — the one list of page sections, shared by the navbar and the footer.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * The navbar and the footer previously each declared their own copy of the nav
 * list. Adding a section meant editing both, and forgetting one left the footer
 * silently out of date. Both now read from here.
 *
 * ─── TO ADD A SECTION TO THE SITE ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *   1. Create the component in `components/sections/`.
 *   2. Give its root `<section>` an `id`.
 *   3. Render it in `app/page.tsx` in the right position.
 *   4. Add one entry to `NAV_LINKS` below, in the same order as the page.
 * The navbar link, the footer link, and the scroll-spy highlight all follow
 * automatically — there is nothing else to wire up.
