/**
 * PRODUCT CONTENT — every claim the site makes about FABINS.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for the marketing and technical copy in
 * the page sections. Components read from it; nothing here imports a component,
 * an icon, or a CSS class, which keeps the content portable if it later moves
 * behind the API.
 *
 * ─── WHICH SECTION READS WHAT ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   ProblemSection    → problemItems      (the four cards)
 *                       marketDrivers     (written, not currently rendered)
 *   AboutSection      → aboutComparisons  (the comparison table rows)
 *   SystemSection     → pipelineSteps     (the carousel)
 *                       hardwarePillars   (the four cards below it)
 *   StandardsSection  → standardsRules    (the four penalty cards)
 *                       standardsDefects  (the interactive defect list)
 *                       gradeThresholds   (the pass/reject scale)
 *                       rollCalculation   (the worked example)
 *
 * ─── TO EDIT COPY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Change the strings below. No component edit is needed — every list is mapped
 * over, so adding or removing an entry is picked up automatically.
 *
 * ─── TWO RULES WHEN ADDING FIELDS ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *   1. No Tailwind classes. Use a semantic `tone` (see `Tone` below) and let
 *      the section decide how to paint it. Colours are a design decision, and
 *      keeping them out of here means a rebrand touches one file, not five.
 *   2. No icon components. Reference an icon by name; the section maps the name
 *      to a component. See `ProblemIconName` below for how that stays type-safe.
