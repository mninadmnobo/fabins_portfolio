/**
 * Converts between {@link ContactInquiry} entities and their DTOs.
 *
 * <p>Mapping lives here rather than being scattered across the service and
 * controller, so there is exactly one place to update when a field is added.
 * Adding a column to the entity has no effect on the public API until this
 * class exposes it — leaking an internal field has to be a deliberate act,
 * not an accident.
 *
 * <p>Written by hand rather than generated with MapStruct or ModelMapper.
 * With one entity the mapping is ten lines, and hand-written code produces
 * clearer stack traces and no build-time code generation to reason about.
