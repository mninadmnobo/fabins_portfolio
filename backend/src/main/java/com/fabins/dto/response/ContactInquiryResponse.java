/**
 * What the API returns for a general contact inquiry.
 *
 * <p>Separate from the {@link com.fabins.entity.ContactInquiry} entity on
 * purpose. The entity is free to grow internal fields — assigned team member,
 * reply notes, internal priority — without any risk of them leaking into a
 * public API response. Everything a client should see must be added here
 * deliberately.
 *
 * <p>Conversion from the entity lives in {@code ContactInquiryMapper}, not
 * here, so this record stays a pure data carrier with no knowledge of
 * persistence or business logic.
 *
 * <p>This response is returned on HTTP 201 after a successful submission, and
 * is the only thing the anonymous submitter will ever receive — there are no
 * public GET endpoints for individual inquiries.
