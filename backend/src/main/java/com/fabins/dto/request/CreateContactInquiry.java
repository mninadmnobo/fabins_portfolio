/**
 * Incoming payload for {@code POST /api/v1/contact}.
 *
 * <p>A record, so it is immutable and Jackson can bind it straight from JSON.
 *
 * <h2>Where validation happens</h2>
 * The annotations below run before the controller method body executes,
 * because the parameter is marked {@code @Valid}. A violation never reaches
 * the service — it is turned into a 400 response listing every offending
 * field by {@code GlobalExceptionHandler}.
 *
 * <h2>Field limits</h2>
 * <strong>Keep these in step</strong> with the column widths on the
 * {@code ContactInquiry} entity and in {@code V3__create_contact_inquiry.sql}.
 * Widening a field here without widening the column would produce a database
 * constraint violation (500) instead of a clean validation error (400).
 *
 * <h2>Honeypot</h2>
 * The form renders a hidden {@code honeypot} field that real users never
 * see or fill. The service treats any non-blank value as a bot submission
 * and silently returns a fake success — the bot cannot distinguish acceptance
 * from rejection, which is the desired effect.
