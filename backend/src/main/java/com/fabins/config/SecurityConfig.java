/**
 * Who can call what, and from which browser origins.
 *
 * <h2>The access model</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code POST /api/v1/deployment-requests} is <strong>public</strong> —
 *       it backs the contact form on the public website.</li>
 *   <li>Every other endpoint on that resource returns submitters' names, email
 *       addresses, and phone numbers, so it requires the {@code ADMIN} role.
 *       Leaving these open would publish the company's entire sales pipeline.</li>
 *   <li>{@code /actuator/health} is public so a load balancer can probe it;
 *       the remaining actuator endpoints are not.</li>
 *   <li>Swagger UI is open in development. See the note on {@code prod} below.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Why HTTP Basic and not JWT</h2>
 * There is exactly one admin account and no browser-based admin UI yet. Basic
 * over HTTPS is the right amount of machinery for that, and swapping it for
 * OAuth2 or JWT later means changing only this class. Do not use Basic without
 * TLS in production — the credentials are merely base64-encoded, not encrypted.

     * Browser origin rules, driven by {@code fabins.cors.allowed-origins}.
     *
     * <p>This is what allows the Next.js frontend on a different origin to call
     * the API. Without it the browser blocks the response — note that CORS is a
     * browser-enforced policy, so it is not a substitute for authentication;
     * anything outside a browser ignores it entirely.
     *
     * <h2>Patterns, not exact origins</h2>
     * {@code setAllowedOriginPatterns} is used rather than
     * {@code setAllowedOrigins}. The two differ in one decisive way: the
     * CORS specification forbids answering a credentialed request with
     * {@code Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *}, so Spring rejects the combination
     * of {@code setAllowedOrigins("*")} and {@code setAllowCredentials(true)} at
     * startup. Patterns sidestep that by matching the incoming {@code Origin}
     * header and echoing it back verbatim, which is both legal and safer than a
     * wildcard because the response names exactly one origin.
     *
     * <p>The practical payoff is that a configured value may contain a wildcard
     * segment — {@code https://*.vercel.app} keeps every Vercel preview
     * deployment working without redeploying the API for each one, and
     * {@code https://fabins.com} still behaves as an exact match. Matching is on
     * the full origin, so scheme, host and port must all agree:
     * {@code https://fabins.com} does <em>not</em> cover
     * {@code https://www.fabins.com}, and {@code http://} does not cover
     * {@code https://}. List both when both are served.
     *
     * <h2>Custom domain checklist</h2>
     * Set {@code FABINS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN} on the platform to the new site origin
     * and redeploy — this bean is built once at startup, so a change to the
     * variable does nothing until the service restarts. See the annotated block
     * in {@code application-prod.yml} for the full procedure.
