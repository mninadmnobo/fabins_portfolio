/**
 * SCROLL ANIMATIONS — the shared entrance presets used across every section.
 *
 * Sections do not write their own Framer Motion config; they spread one of the
 * helpers below. That is what keeps the whole page moving with a single rhythm,
 * and means the site's motion can be retuned from this one file.
 *
 * ─── TYPICAL USE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   <motion.div {...fadeUpProps()}>…</motion.div>          // immediate
 *   <motion.div {...fadeUpProps(0.15)}>…</motion.div>      // 150ms later
 *
 * For a list, multiply by the index so the items cascade:
 *   items.map((item, i) => <motion.div key={item.id} {...fadeUpProps(i * 0.07)} />)
 *
 * ─── ACCESSIBILITY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * These are transform and opacity animations, which are safe under
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` in a way that parallax or large motion would not be.
 * The CSS-driven marquee is disabled outright for those visitors — see the
 * media query at the bottom of `app/globals.css`.
